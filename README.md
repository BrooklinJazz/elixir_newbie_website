# ElixirNewbie [WIP]

Elixir Newbie is a podcast about what it's like being new to Elixir. I (Brooklin Myers) share my experience, document my process, and summarize what I learn to help and encourage new Elixir developers.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
  * Configure your .env file with the required environment variables

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

This project relies on environment variables to run.
