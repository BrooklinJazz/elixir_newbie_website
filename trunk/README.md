# ElixirNewbie

Elixir Newbie is a podcast about what it's like being new to Elixir. I (Brooklin Myers) share my experience, document my process, and summarize what I learn to help and encourage new Elixir developers.

To start your Phoenix server:
  * install elixir/erlang/node from .tool-versions with asdf `asdf install`
  * ensure you have postgresql started `sudo service postgresql start`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Unfortunately this project isn't easy to run out of the box yet, but I'm working on it!
