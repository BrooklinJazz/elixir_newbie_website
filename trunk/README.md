# ElixirNewbie

Elixir Newbie is a podcast about what it's like being new to Elixir. I (Brooklin Myers) share my experience, document my process, and summarize what I learn to help and encourage new Elixir developers.

If you're new to github here's how to get started: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/

## Prerequisites
- [WSL for WINDOWS USERS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- check .tool-versions for the current node, elixir, and erlang plugins.
